    This mode scopes styles within a component by using the web standard Shadow DOM API. When enabling this mode, Angular attaches a shadow root to the component's host element and renders the component's template and styles into the corresponding shadow tree.
    
    This mode strictly guarantees that only that component's styles apply to elements in the component's template. Global styles cannot affect elements in a shadow tree and styles inside the shadow tree cannot affect elements outside of that shadow tree.
    
    Enabling ShadowDom encapsulation, however, impacts more than style scoping. Rendering the component in a shadow tree affects event propagation, interaction with the &lt;slot&gt; API, and how browser developer tools show elements. Always understand the full implications of using Shadow DOM in your application before enabling this option.
